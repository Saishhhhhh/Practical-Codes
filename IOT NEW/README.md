# IoT Practical Experiments

## Experiment 5
Controls LED output using digital pins.

## Experiment 6
Create a program that illuminates the green LED if the counter is less than 100, illuminate the yellow LED if the counter is between 101 and 200 and illuminates the red LED if the counter is greater than 200.

## Experiment 7
Create a program so that when the user enters:
- 'b' - the green light blinks
- 'g' - the green light is illuminated
- 'y' - the yellow light is illuminated
- 'r' - the red light is illuminated

## Experiment 8
Write a program that asks the user for a number and outputs the number squared that is entered.

## Experiment 9
RGB LED control with potentiometers.

## Experiment 10
Write a program read the temperature sensor and send the values to the serial monitor on the computer.

## Experiment 11
Write a program using piezo element and use it to play a tune after someone knocks.

## Experiment 12
Understanding the connectivity of Raspberry-Pi/Beagle board circuit/Arduino with IR sensor. Write an application to detect obstacle and notify user using LEDs.
